# Tidying (1/6)


.pull-left[

[tidyr](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/tidyr.pdf) can help getting from untidy to tidy data in R!

- `separate()` separates data by tidying columns with two variables or values (`unite()` does the opposite.)

- `pivot_wider()` pivots data by tidying columns with more than one variable.

- `pivot_longer()` pivots data by tidying rows that contain variables.
  
Let's see how this works in the following slides...

# Tidying (2/6)

Is this tidy or untidy data?

```{r}
untidy_population <- data.frame("Country" = c("Afghanistan-middle east",
                                            "Brazil-south america",
                                            "China-eastern asia"),
                                "year_1999" = c(19987071, 172006362, 1272915272),
                                "year_2000" = c(20595360, 174504898, 1280428583))
untidy_population
```

How to make this data tidy?

---

# Tidying (3/6)

Let's `separate()` columns

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyr)
tidy_population <- separate(untidy_population, Country,
                            sep="-", into=c("country", "region"))
tidy_population
```

--

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyr)
tidy_population <- separate(untidy_population, Country,
                            sep="-", into=c("country", "region"))
tidy_population
```

--

What else could we do to make this even tidier?

---

# Tidying (4/6)

Let's pivot the data long

- `pivot_longer()` pivots  data by tidying rows that contain variables (i.e. means more observations, a *longer* dataset)

--

```{r, eval=FALSE}
pivot_longer(tidy_population,
             cols = c("year_1999","year_2000"),
             names_to = "year",
             values_to = "population")
```

--

```{r, echo=FALSE}
pivot_longer(tidy_population,
             cols = c("year_1999","year_2000"),
             names_to = "year",
             values_to = "population")
```

# Tidying (5/6)

Another untidy example

```{r}
untidy_burgers <- data.frame(Lecturer = c("Henrique", "Livio",
                                          "Henrique", "Livio",
                                          "Henrique", "Livio"),
                             Burger_joint = c("Inglewoods", "Inglewoods",
                                              "H. Foundation", "H. Foundation",
                                              "Holy Cow", "Holy Cow"),
                             Grade = c(7, 10, 5, 5, 9, 7))
untidy_burgers
```

How to make this data tidier?

# Tidying (6/6)

Let's pivot this data wide

- `pivot_wider()` pivots data by tidying columns with more than one variable (i.e. this means more variables, a *wider* dataset)

--

```{r, eval=FALSE}
pivot_wider(untidy_burgers,
            names_from = Burger_joint,
            values_from = Grade)
```

--

```{r, echo=FALSE}

# Wrangling (1/8)

Now that things are tidier, it's time to wrangle data!

--

.pull-left[

By wrangling, we mean manipulating data, and for this we usually use the [dplyr](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/data-transformation.pdf) package!

]

.pull-right[
![:scale 20%](assets/images/dplyr.png)
]

> The dplyr package is a **grammar of data manipulation**, providing a consistent set of verbs that help you solve the most common data manipulation challenges: creating,adding, picking, reducing, and changing variables.

```{r include=FALSE}
library(readr)
io_income <- read_csv("io_income_rs.csv")
country_region <- read_csv("country_region.csv")
```

---

# Wrangling (2/8)

Let's load some data on the income of international organizations

```{r}
library(dplyr)
slice_head(io_income, n = 10)
```

---

# Wrangling (3/8)

Let's `select()` some variables

```{r, eval=FALSE}
select(io_income, donor, type_donor)
```

--

```{r, echo=FALSE}
slice_head(select(io_income, donor, type_donor), n = 10)
```

---

# Wrangling (4/8)

`filter ()` subsets data by a condition in the observations

```{r, eval=FALSE}
filter(io_income, donor == "Switzerland")
```

--

```{r, echo=FALSE}
slice_head(filter(io_income, donor=="Switzerland"), n = 10)
```

---

# Wrangling (5/8)

`mutate ()` creates new variables, often with new values, from other variables

```{r}
io_income_mutate <- mutate(io_income,
                           thousands_USD = amount_nominal/1000)
```

--

```{r echo=FALSE}
slice_head(io_income_mutate, n = 10)
```

---

# Wrangling (6/8)

Grouping and summarizing are powerful tidy tools!

- `group_by()` groups data based on a characteristic to subsequently perform certain operations

- `summarise()` creates a new dataframe by combining grouped variables.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
io_income_grouped <- group_by(io_income, type_donor)
summarise(io_income_grouped, amount_nominal = sum(amount_nominal,
                                                  na.rm = TRUE))
```

--

```{r echo=FALSE}
io_income_grouped <- group_by(io_income, type_donor)
summarise(io_income_grouped,
          amount_nominal = sum(amount_nominal,
                               na.rm = TRUE))
```

---

# Wrangling (7/8)

dplyr has a family of functions that help you join multiple datasets: `left_join(), right_join(), inner_join(), full_join() ` ...

- [This great post on all merging possibilities and details with dplyr.]( https://statisticsglobe.com/r-dplyr-join-inner-left-right-full-semi-anti)

--

Let's get a new dataset which contains regions for each country to see these joins work!

```{r}
sample_n(country_region, 5)
```

---

# Wrangling (8/8)

If I wanted to add a region column in the income of international organizations data, which join should I use?

--

```{r}
left_join(io_income, country_region)
```

---

# There are many others dplyr verbs that we did cover here....

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
arrange() # orders row by values
rename() # renames variables
distinct() # keep only distinct rows
slice() # selects rows by position
count() # counts number of rows with unique values
```

- Tidy data and piping are both *intuitive* and *powerful*
