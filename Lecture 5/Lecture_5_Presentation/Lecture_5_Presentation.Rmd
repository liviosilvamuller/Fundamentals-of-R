Conceptually:

- Gestalt principles

- Tufte's law

- One plot, one story

.pull-right[

Practically:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data, mapping = aes()) # Do you remember mapping vs setting aesthetics?
# geom_*() # What does the geom functions do?
geom_line() # layering lines
geom_points() # layering points
geom_col() # layering columns
geom_boxplot() # layering box plots
geom_smooth() # layering line over patterns
labs() # modifies plot labels
theme() # customize plot components
# theme_*() # family of preset themes
```

**What about scales and normalization?**

# R Markdown, a one-stop shop (Rmd 1/4)

- Write your text, execute code, and produce high quality (reproducible) reports in [one place](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/gallery.html)!

- [Made for R, free, and with lots of support](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)

- [Do not underestimate R Markdown's potential or flexibility cause it is ugly!](https://towardsdatascience.com/ten-awesome-r-markdown-tricks-56ef6d41098)

---

# Common Issue (Rmd 2/4)

- Adding data (just like a script)

- Latex engines (for PDF rendering)

- [Figures and citations in PDF](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/pdf-document.html)

- Other specific RMD issues you had?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tinytex")
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

# From R Markdown with care (Rmd 3/4)

- [Articles](https://resulumit.com/teaching/rmd_workshop.html#44)

- [Presentations](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/xaringan.html)

- [Books](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/)

- [Interactive applications](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/rmarkdown.html)

- And more [cool stuff](https://slides.yihui.org/2019-dahshu-rmarkdown#22) ...

# Quarto, the future? (Rmd 4/4)

- [Quarto is handy for users of multiple programming languages, but is it really necessary for R users?](https://yihui.org/en/2022/04/quarto-r-markdown/)

- [Is Quarto just a fancier R Markdown?](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/r.html)

- R Studio's, or shall I say ["Posit"](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3668252/rstudio-changes-name-to-posit-expands-focus-to-include-python-and-vs-code.html#:~:text=RStudio%20is%20changing%20its%20corporate,user%20conference%20in%20Washington%2C%20D.C.), attempt to become a more flexible platform

**Attention, Quarto requires the latest version of R Studio...**

# Exchanging with the community (Reprex 1/3)

- You do not need any package to make a minimal reproducible example, but the [reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) package can help!

- Reproducibility of an error is the key

- Don't forget about the [minimal](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/articles/reprex-dos-and-donts.html) part

- The better the question, the better the [answer](https://data.library.virginia.edu/ask-better-code-questions-and-get-better-answers-with-reprex/)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("reprex")
reprex::reprex(mean(c(2, 3, 4, NA_character_)))
# use "{}" for multiple lines
```

---

# Stack overflow (Reprex 2/3)

- You can find virtually anything about an [R issue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r)

- [R community can sometimes be annoying, so ask well](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2011/01/three-tips-for-posting-good-questions-to-r-help-and-stack-overflow/)

- If anything, remember the golden rule of copy and paste

**[R bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/), [Community R](https://community.rstudio.com/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats), and even [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rstats/), if that is your thing**

---

# Github (Reprex 3/3)

- [Code hosting platform for collaborations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E)

- Make your research available online (just like [Livio](https://github.com/liviosilvamuller) and [I](https://github.com/henriquesposito))

- From hosting your websites and applications, to other types of online collaborative [work](https://happygitwithr.com/big-picture.html)

# Individual data ethics (Ethics 1/2)

## This course, hopefully, has provided you with the tools to keep on learning R on your own but...

.pull-left[

- Consent (also for data)

- Privacy vs. transparency (a thin-line)

- Fairness (data is interpreted but...)

- Reproducibility

# The final assignment

- Please submit a PDF (or HTML) document

- We expect you to also interpret the code outputs

- Bonus question

**We will hold office hours normally for the next 2 weeks.**
