# R Basics

*"All I know is what I have words for” - Ludwig Wittgenstein*

--

## Objects

- What are objects in R?

*Can be almost anything, as long as it is assigned...*

```{r}
"Am I an object?"
object <- "Or I am an object?"
```

---
class: split two

# Class 1 - The Rules of the Game

Objects can have multiple classes.

*Object class is the grouping of objects that can be described in terms of the attributes its members have in common.*

--

## Character (or string)

--

```{r}
# What can we do with character objects?
object1 <- "Or I am an object?"
class(object1)
paste(object1, object1, sep = " - ")
```

---

# Class 2 - Operations

Some classes allow for arithmetic operations.

## Numeric (or integer)

```{r}
# Can we operate on numeric objects?
object2 <- 1
class(object2)
(object2+object2)*(object2*object2)/(object2/object2)-(object2-object2)
# Remember, brackets are important for order of operations!
```

---

# Class 3 - Can anything be a class?

--

*Yes (as long as the rules of the game are set as methods and are coherent)!*

--

## Factors

--

*Factor in R refers to a categorical variable that stores strings or integers as levels*

```{r}
lectures <- as.factor(c("Lecture 1", "Lecture 1", "Block 1")) 
class(lectures)
levels(lectures)
```

---

# Class 4 - Dates

Dates in R can be annoying, specially if you are using base R...

Some R packages are excellent for this though [´{lubridate}´](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v040i03) and [´{messydates}´](https://globalgov.github.io/messydates/)

```{r}
Sys.Date() # get the current date
dates <- as.Date(c("2022-09-23", "2022-09-30"))
class(dates)
# What can we do with data?
dates[2] - dates[1]
```

# (Object) class matters...

]

.pull-right[
```{r}
as.numeric(as.Date("1970-01-01"))
```
]

---

# Data structures 1 - Vectors

*Vector*: a one-dimensional vector with one type of data (double, integers, character, logical)

```{r}
lecturers <- c("Henrique", "Livio") # character
age <- c(81, 18) # numeric
speaks_portuguese <- c(TRUE, TRUE) # logical
is.vector(c(lecturers, age, speaks_portuguese)) # logical test
```

---

class: split two

# Data structures 2 - Matrixes and Arrays

.pull-left[

*Matrix*: two dimensional objects with one class and a fixed number of rows/columns

```{r}
matrix <- matrix(ncol = 2, nrow = 2)
matrix
dim(matrix) # get dimensions
# Names are vector attributes
# row.names(matrix) <- c("Henrique", "Livio")
# dimnames(matrix) # get dimension names
```

]

.pull-left[

*Array*: multi-dimensional, one class, and not contrained by rows/columns, but not as flexible as a matrix...

```{r, eval=FALSE}
array(c(1:2, 3:4, 5:7), dim = c(2, 2, 3))
```

]

---

# Data structures 3 - Lists

*lists*: group together R objects of diverse classes or dimensions

```{r}
list <- list(lecturers, age, speaks_portuguese)
list
```

---

# Data structures 4 - Data Frames

- As lists, data frames objects can have multiple possible classes.

```{r}
# Does data have a class?
course <- data.frame(cbind(lecturers, age))
course
# cbind() binds columns, rbind() binds rows
class(course) # Pop Quiz: How come "data.frame" is a class?
```

# Navigate Data

Is the "$" operator a function in R (see ´ ?"$"´)?

```{r}
# $ operators extracts or replace parts of an object
course$lecturers
course$age <- factor(as.character(course$age), levels = c("18", "81"))
# Can you tell what the code above is doing?
levels(course$age)
```

But brackets :[] also make great friends

```{r, eval=FALSE}
course[1] # first column
course[1, ] # first row in all columns
course[1,1] # value in first row of the first column
course[1:2, 2] # the two first values in column 2
```

---

# Logical operators

- "=="/"!=" are values equal/different?
- is bigger/smaller ">"/"<"  than?
- for multiple conditions, use and/or "&"/"|"

```{r, eval=FALSE}
course$lecturers[1] == course$lecturers[2]
nchar(course$lecturers[1]) > nchar(course$lecturers[2])
course$lecturers[1] != course$lecturers[2] & nchar(course$lecturers[1]) >= nchar(course$lecturers[2])
```

The vectorized "ifelse()" function for coditional element selection... (wait what?)

```{r}
course$'Is ifelse() awesome?' = ifelse(course$lecturers == "Henrique", "Awesome", "It is okay...")
course
```

---

# GREP (Grammar of Regular Expressions)

Functions to find, match and replace strings!

```{r}
# Can we find if there is an "okay()" in a variable?
grepl("okay", course$`Is ifelse() awesome?`, ignore.case = TRUE)
# What if we want to replace it?
course$`Is ifelse() awesome?` <- gsub("okay", "awesome", course$`Is ifelse() awesome?`, ignore.case = TRUE)
course$`Is ifelse() awesome?`
```

# Base vs. Tidy (again)

- All operators we cover today here and in the practice exercises are base R.

- In reality, most users should use both, whatever is easier and more intuitive to you!

- [Above all, teaching base R facilitates comprehension of how R, as a software and programming language, works for beginners](https://github.com/matloff/TidyverseSkeptic/)
