# R Basics

*"All I know is what I have words for” - Ludwig Wittgenstein*

--

## Objects

- What are objects in R?

--

*Can be anything, as long as it is assigned...*

```{r}
"Am I an object?"
object <- "Or I am an object?"
```

---

# The Rules of the Game (class 1/6)

*Object class is the grouping of objects that can be described in terms of the attributes its members have in common.*

## Can anything be a class?

--

*Yes (as long as the rules of the game are set as methods and are coherent)!*

But we are only talking about a few basic ones today...

---

# Character (class 2/6)

Just text

```{r}
object1 <- "Or I am an object?"
class(object1)
# What can we do with character objects?
paste(object1, object1, sep = " - ")
```

---

# Numeric (class 3/6)

Some classes allow for arithmetic operations

```{r}
object2 <- 3
class(object2)
# Can we operate on numeric objects?
(object2*object2)/(object2+object2)
# Remember, brackets are important for order of operations!
```

---

# Logical (class 4/6)

Either TRUE or FALSE

```{r}
object3 <- c(TRUE, FALSE)
class(object3)
isTRUE(object3[2]) # Logical check
```

---

# Dates (class 5/6)

Dates in R can be annoying, specially if you are using base R...

```{r}
Sys.Date() # get the current date
object4 <- as.Date(c("2022-09-23", "2022-09-30"))
class(object4) # What can we do with data?
object4[2] - object4[1]
```

Some R packages are excellent for this though [´{lubridate}´](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v040i03) and [´{messydates}´](https://globalgov.github.io/messydates/)

# You can navigate (through data) if you have $

--

Is the "$" operator a function in R (see ´?"$"´)?

```{r}
# The $ operators can be used to extract part from an object:
course$lecturers
# Or replace parts of an object:
course$lecturers <- c("Sposito", "Silva-Muller")
```

---

# If you do not have $, friends can help!

--

Indeed brackets :[] make some great friends

```{r}
course[1] # first column
course[1, ] # first row in all columns
course[1,1] # value in first row of the first column
course[1:2, 2] # the two first values in column 2
```

---

# Factors

*Factor* in R refers to categories in variables

```{r}
course$lecturers <- factor(course$lecturers, levels = c("Silva-Muller", "Sposito"))
course$lecturers
```

---

# Logical operators

- "=="/"!=" are values equal/different?
- is bigger/bigger or equal ">"/">="  than?
- is smaller/smaller or equal "<"/"<=" than?

```{r}
course$lecturers[1] == course$lecturers[2]
course$age[2] < course$age[1]
```

**For multiple conditions, use "&"/"|" (and/or)**

```{r}
course$lecturers[1] != course$lecturers[2] & course$age[2] < course$age[1]
```

---
# If it is true, then yes!

We function ´ifelse()´ works with coditional element selection... (wait what?)

--

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ifelse(test, yes, no)
```

--

```{r}
course$old = ifelse(course$age > 30, "old", "young")
course
```

---

# GREP (Grammar of Regular Expressions)

Functions to find, match and replace strings!

```{r}
# Can we find if there is an "silva" in a variable?
grepl("silva", course$lecturers, ignore.case = TRUE)
# What if we want to replace it?
course$lecturers <- gsub("Silva", "Awesome", course$lecturers)
course
```

# Base vs. Tidy (again)

- All operators we cover today here and in the practice exercises are base R.

- In reality, most users should use both, whatever is easier and more intuitive to you!

- [Above all, teaching base R facilitates comprehension of how R, as a software and programming language, works for beginners](https://github.com/matloff/TidyverseSkeptic/)
