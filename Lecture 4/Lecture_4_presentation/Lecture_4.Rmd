#What makes good visualization?

--

- *Gestalt Principles*: sizes, colors, and shapes can structure a plot.

--

- *Tufte's Principle*: too much visual information makes comprehension more difficult.

--

##In other words:

- Leverage size, color, and shapes to...

- ...decrease unnecessary information while highlighting necessary information,

- **So one plot, tells one story clearly**.

---
## Gestalt principles (1/5)

![:scale 50%](assets/images/structure.png)

- We look for structure... and we infer relationships from structure!

--

  - **Proximity**: things that are spatially near to one another seem related.
  
--

  - **Similarity**: things that look alike seem to be related.
  
--

  - **Connections**: things that are connected seem to be related.

##  Gestalt principles: sizing things (3/5)

- Size, more than order, will define what is noticed first.
- Size things around and in your plot by their hierarchy of importance.

##  Gestalt principles: shapping and colouring things (5/5)

.pull-left[

- Shape or color are good when you want to show contrast.

- Both together are often too much.
  - If you have color, shape, and two axis you are plotting 4 variables!

- Choose colors based on
  - the relationship: continuous or discrete?
  - intution: red for high temperatures, blue for low.

- *Remember: colorblindness is more frequent than you think!*

# How do I plot?

--
We will use a package called the [´{ggplot2}´](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)


> ggplot2 is a system for declaratively creating graphics, based on **The Grammar of Graphics**. You provide the data, tell ggplot2 how to map variables to aesthetics, what graphical primitives to use, and it takes care of the details.

--

- Map variables to aesthetics: linking data do things you see.
- Graphical primitives: type of graph you want ( line, box, scatter...)
---
#ggplot2: a general workflow (1/)

- Tell ggplot2 **what we want to see**: the data and the variables.
  - What are our axis?
  - Do we want colors?
  - Do we want sizes?
  
--
  
- Tell ggplot2 **how you want to see it**: the types of graphs (points, lines, boxes)
  - What type of graph we want?
  - Do we want more graphs on it?
  - Do we want to add some summary statistics?
  
--

- Tell ggplot2 **how to improve what is there**: scales, labels, titles, marks and so forth.
  - Do we want titles, sub-titles, captions?
  - Are the scales meaningful?
  - Are legends and marks explanatory?

library(gapminder) #downloading the package with the data

#ggplot2: what we want to see (2/)

.pull-left[

First, let's tell ggplot what data we have, and how to map variables to aesthetics.
  - Our data is gapminder.
  - Our x will be GDP per capita, our y life expectancy.
 
```{r}

library(ggplot2)
p<- ggplot(data=gapminder, mapping=aes(x=gdpPercap, y=lifeExp))

```

```{r}
p
```

#ggplot2: how we want to see (3/)

.pull-left[

Second, let's tell ggplot2 how we want to see the relationships.
- `geom_point()` inherits the x and y as we specified inside the `ggplot()`, and draws points for observations.
- We can just **add** the geom to the object p we created.
- In ggplot2 we add things, because we are **layering** rather than piping.
 
```{r}
p <- p+ geom_point()
```

]

--

.pull-right[

```{r echo=FALSE}

p

```
]
---
#ggplot2: how we want to see (4/)

.pull-left[

- `geom_()` is a family of functions that built various types of graphs (bar, lines, boxes)

- There are multiple kinds of geoms, you can check them in the cheat sheet for [´{ggplot2}´](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/data-visualization-2.1.pdf)

- Following the logic of layering, you can just add a new geom to the object we have.

- In this case, we are adding `geom_smooth()`.
```{r}

p<- p+ geom_smooth() #smooth plots a trend line.

```

]

--

.pull-right[

```{r echo=FALSE}
p
```

#ggplot2: how to improve what we see (5/)

- Third (and finally), we improve what we see.
  - We can scale x in log because the range of gdpPercap is too big.
  - We specify that gdpPercap is in dollars, so the axis show it properly.
  - We can add and size titles, subtitles, and caption.
  - We can change the axis titles.
 
 
```{r}
p<- p+
  scale_x_log10(labels=scales::dollar) + # scale_x_log10() rescales our x to improve visualization
  labs( x="Life Expectancy", y=" GDP per Capita",
        title= "The Relantionship between Life Expectancy and GDP per Capita",
        subtitle=" Dataset composed of 142 countries from 1952 to 2007",
        caption= "Source: Gapminder Dataset",
        color="" ) + # labs add axis titles, titles, subtitles, and captions.
  theme(title = element_text(color="black", size=12, face="bold"),
        axis.text = element_text(color="black", size=10),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(color="black", size=10, face= "plain"),
        plot.caption = element_text(color="black", size=8, face="bold"))
#theme() resizes, changes face, font and many others.
```
