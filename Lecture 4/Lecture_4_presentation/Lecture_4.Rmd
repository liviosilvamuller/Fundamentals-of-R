#What makes good visualization?

--

- *Gestalt Principles*: sizes, colors, and shapes can structure a plot.

--

- *Tufte's Principle*: too much visual information makes comprehension more difficult.

--

##In other words:

- Leverage size, color, and shapes to...

- ...decrease unnecessary information while highlighting necessary information,

- **So one plot, tells one story clearly**.

---
## Gestalt principles (1/5)

![:scale 50%](assets/images/structure.png)

- We look for structure... and we infer relationships from structure!

--

  - **Proximity**: things that are spatially near to one another seem related.
  
--

  - **Similarity**: things that look alike seem to be related.
  
--

  - **Connections**: things that are connected seem to be related.

---
##  Gestalt principles: sizing things (3/5)

- Size, more than order, will define what is noticed first.
- Size things around and in your plot by their hierarchy of importance.

##  Gestalt principles: shapping and colouring things (5/5)

.pull-left[

- Shape or color are good when you want to show contrast.

- Both together are often too much.
  - If you have color, shape, and two axis you are plotting 4 variables!

- Choose colors based on
  - the relationship: continuous or discrete?
  - intution: red for high temperatures, blue for low.

- *Remember: colorblindness is more frequent than you think!*

# How do I plot?

--
We will use a package called the [´{ggplot2}´](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)


> ggplot2 is a system for declaratively creating graphics, based on **The Grammar of Graphics**. You provide the data, tell ggplot2 how to map variables to aesthetics, what graphical primitives to use, and it takes care of the details.

--

- Map variables to aesthetics: linking data do things you see.
- Graphical primitives: type of graph you want ( line, box, scatter...)

---
#ggplot2: Basic structure

```{r}

library(gapminder) #downloading the package with the data
library(dplyr) # loading dplyr
data("gapminder") # loading the data from the package
sample_n(gapminder,15) #showing a random sample

```

---
#ggplot2: Basic structure

.pull-left[

First, let's tell ggplot what data we have, and how to map variables to aesthetics.
  - Our data is gapminder.
  - Our x will be GDP per capita, our y life expectancy.
 
```{r}

library(ggplot2)
p<- ggplot(data=gapminder, mapping=aes(x=gdpPercap, y=lifeExp))

```

]

--

.pull-right[

```{r}
p
```
]


---
#ggplot2: Basic structure

.pull-left[

Second, let's tell ggplot2 what plot we want.
- We want a scatterplot, so we call `geom_point()`.
- We can just **add** the geom to the object p we created.
- In ggplot2 we add things, because we are **layering** rather than piping.
 
```{r}

p2<- p+ geom_point()

```

]

--

.pull-right[

```{r}
p2
```
]
---
#ggplot2: Basic structure

.pull-left[

There are multiple kinds of geom, you can check them in [´{ggplot2 Cheat Sheet}´](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/data-visualization-2.1.pdf)
 
```{r}

p3<- p+ geom_boxplot()

```
