# Income of International Organizations

The 'io_income_rs.csv' dataset contains funding data from some international organizations in Geneva.

Please load the dataset, we will be working with it today.

*Tip: Adding titles, legends, and themes to your plots helps us help you!*

## Question 1

Create a bar plot displaying the top 10 overall donors and their total donations to all international organizations. Please color the donors by their type (e.g. public or private).

## Question 2

Has the amount the US donates to all issue areas increased over time? Please illustrate this relationship in a line plot, colored by the respective issue areas.

## Question 3

Plot the distribution of all donations in the year 2000 and in the year 2020 comparing public and private donors. Are there outliers for either of these types of donors in 2000? What about in 2020? (Tip: box plots are great for distributions)

## Question 4

Make a scatter plot for all donations towards health by year since 2000. Please label the donors (tip: "geom_text(aes(label = donor))") and shape by their dots according to their type (tip: use "geom_point(aes(shape = donor_type"))"). Why do you think the amount donated towards peace fluctuates in time?

## Question 5

Has the amount the US donates to all issue areas increased over time? Please illustrate this relationship with a geom_area(), colored by the respective issue areas.
