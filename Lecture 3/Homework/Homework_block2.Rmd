# Courses at the Graduate Institute

The Graduate Institute offers courses in spring and autumn. The datasets `autumn_21.csv` and `spring_22.csv`
contain information on all courses offered by the Graduate Institute in the academic year 2021-2022. 

## Question 1

Your first task is to consolidate both datasets in a single dataset:academic_year.
This dataset should contain the following variables:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Name                 Description
 -------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------
 `title_course`       Title of the course
 
 `department`         Department that offers the course (MINT, EI, RISP, HPI, DI...)
 
 `language`           Language in which the course is instructed (French or English)
 
 `ECTS`               How many ECTS you can get for the course.
 
 `semester`           Takes the categories autumn or spring.
 
  `type`              Type of course(compulsory, elective, or workshop)
  
  `topic`            A broad category that summarizes the topic
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Question 2

- Homw many courses were offered in total?
- How many courses were offered in French?
- How many courses were offered in (1) in autumn in English, (2) in autumn in French, (3) in spring in English,and (3) in spring in French.
 
## Question 3

- Rank the departments by the number of courses offered in each semester.

## Question 4

- Which department offers a higher share of courses on (1) autumn, and on (2) spring?
Remember: different departments offer a different quantity of courses.

## Question 5

- List the three favorite topics overall.
- List the three favorite topics of each department.

## Question 6

One of the categories of `type` is workshops. Workshops are normally about skills,
but in the dataset, workshops are missing values for `topic`. Assign
the category skills at the `topic` variable for all workshops.

## Question 7

Are compulsory courses mostly about  theory and methods in all departments? 
Now, create a new variable that that takes the value of 1 if the course is compulsory and about theories or methods. 
The variable should take the value of 0 if it compulsory and about something else.

## Question 8

The `faculty_n.xlsx` dataset contains the number of faculty per department.
In which department faculty teaches more ECTs on average? 
Before proceeding, remove observations from DE and IA.
