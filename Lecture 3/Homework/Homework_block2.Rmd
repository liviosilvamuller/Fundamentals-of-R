 `title_course`       Title of the course
 
 `department`         Department that offers the course (MINT, EI, RISP, HPI, DI...)
 
 `language`           Language in which the course is instructed (french or english)
 
 `ECTS`               How many ECTS you can get for the course.
 
 `semester`           Takes the categories autumn or spring.
 
  `type`              Type of course(compulsory, elective, or workshop)

but in the dataset, workshops are missing values for topic. Assign
the category skills at the topic variable for all workshops.
