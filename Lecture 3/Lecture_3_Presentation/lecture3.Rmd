# What is the tidyverse? (1/2)


Universe of tidiness? From the [´{tidyverse}´](https://www.tidyverse.org/) website:


> The tidyverse is an opinionated **collection of R packages** designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.

# Tidy datasets (1/4)

  - What is a tidy dataset?
    - Each column is one variable.
    - Each row is one case/observation.
    - Each cell stores one value.

# So, how we get to a tidy datasets?

## We use [´{tidyr}´](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/tidyr.pdf)

- `separate()` separates data by tidying columns with two variables or values.
  - `unite()` does the opposite.

- `pivot_wider()` extends data by tidying columns with more than one variable.
- `pivot_longer()` extends data by tidying rows that contain variables.
  
  

  
## Let's test this in the following slides.
---

# Here is some untidy data from earlier


```{r include=FALSE}

library(readxl)
untidy_population_dat <- read_excel("~/Documents/GitHub/Fundamentals_of_R_IHEID2022/Lecture 3/Lecture_3_Presentation/assets/data/untidy_dat.xlsx")
untidy_food <- read_excel("~/Documents/GitHub/Fundamentals_of_R_IHEID2022/Lecture 3/Lecture_3_Presentation/assets/data/untidy_dat2.xlsx")

# `separate()` and `unite()`

```

```{r}

tidy_population <- separate (untidy_population_dat, country, sep="-", into=c("country", "region"))

```

--

```{r echo=FALSE}

tidy_population

```
---

# `pivot_longer()`

- `pivot_longer()` extends  data by tidying rows that contain variables.
 - this means more observations, i.e. *longer* dataset.

```{r}

tidy_population <- pivot_longer(tidy_population,cols=c("1999","2000"), names_to="year", values_to = "population")

```
--
```{r echo=FALSE}

tidy_population

```
---

# `pivot_wider()`

- `pivot_wider()` extends data by tidying columns with more than one variable.
 - this means more variables, i.e. *wider*.

-Tidy data is great for working with tidy packages.

##Think about it conceptually before tidying everything!

---

# Now that things are tidy (or tidier), it's time to wrangle

--

By wrangling, we mean manipulating, and for this we use [´{dplyr}´](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/data-transformation.pdf)
--

> The dplyr package is a **grammar of data manipulation**, providing a consistent set of verbs that help you solve the most common data manipulation challenges: creating,adding, picking, reducing, and changing variables.


```{r include=FALSE}

library(readr)

io_income <- read_csv("~/Documents/GitHub/Fundamentals_of_R_IHEID2022/Lecture 3/Lecture_3_Presentation/assets/data/io_income_rs.csv")

country_region <- read_csv("~/Documents/GitHub/Fundamentals_of_R_IHEID2022/Lecture 3/Lecture_3_Presentation/assets/data/country_region.csv")

library(dplyr)

```

---
##Let's work with dataset on the income of international organizations!

```{r}
head(io_income)
```

---
# Select (dplyr verbs 1/5)

`select ()` selects variables in the dataframe.



```{r}

io_income_select <- select(io_income, donor, type_donor)

```
--
```{r}

head (io_income_select)

```
---
##...glimpse the dataset

```{r echo=FALSE}
head(io_income)
```
---
# Filter (dplyr verbs 2/5)

`filter ()` subsets data frame by a condition in the observations.

```{r}
io_income_filter <- filter(io_income, donor=="Switzerland")
```
--
```{r echo=FALSE}
io_income_filter
```

---
##...glimpse the dataset

```{r echo=FALSE}
head(io_income)
```
---
# Mutate (dplyr verbs 3/5)

`mutate ()` creates new variables.


```{r}
io_income_mutate <- mutate(io_income,thousands_USD=amount_nominal/1000)
```
-- 
```{r echo=FALSE}
io_income_mutate
```

---
##...glimpse the dataset

```{r}
head(io_income)
```
---
# Group_by and Summarise (dplyr verbs 4/5)

`group_by()` groups data based on a characteristic to subsequently perform certain operations.
`summarise()` creates a new dataframe by combining grouped variables.


```{r}

io_income_grouped<- group_by(io_income, type_donor)

io_income_summarised <- summarise(io_income_grouped, amount_nominal = sum(amount_nominal, na.rm = TRUE))
```
--
```{r echo=FALSE}
io_income_summarised
```
---
# Joining things (dplyr verbs 5/5)

dplyr has a family of functions that help you join multiple datasets: `left_join(), right_join(), inner_join(), full_join() ` ...
- let's check a random sample of a new dataset (country_region), which contains regions for each country.

```{r}
sample_n(country_region, 5)
```

- We can join this to our io_income dataset, and get regions for each country.
---
# Joining things (dplyr verbs 5/5)
```{r echo=FALSE}
sample_n(io_income, 3)
```

```{r}
io_income_regions <- left_join(io_income, country_region)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}

tail(io_income_regions)

```

---

# and many others dplyr verbs that we cannot cover here....

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}

arrange() #orders row by values
rename() #renames variables
distinct() #keep only distinct rows
slice() #selects rows by position
count() #counts number of rows with unique values
...

# The Pipe Operator `%>%` (1/3)

- So far, we have been doing *object-oriented programming*.

- This means we assign (<-) the result of an operation to an object.

- We then operate on the newly created object.

```{r}
io_income_filtered<- filter(io_income, year > "2018")

io_income_grouped2 <- group_by(io_income_filtered, year)

io_income_summarised2 <- summarise(io_income_grouped2, amount_nominal = sum(amount_nominal, na.rm = TRUE))
```
--
```{r echo=FALSE}
io_income_summarised2
```

---
# The Pipe Operator `%>%` (2/3)

- The pipe operator (%>%) changes this logic.

- It takes the output of one function and passes it into another function as an argument.

- This is why we call it *functional-programming*.

```{r}

io_income %>%
filter(year > "2018") %>%
group_by(year) %>%
summarise(amount_nominal = sum(amount_nominal, na.rm = TRUE))

```

.fifty[Check: [Plumbers, chains, and famous painters: The (updated) history of the pipe operator in R]( http://adolfoalvarez.cl/blog/2021-09-16-plumbers-chains-and-famous-painters-the-history-of-the-pipe-operator-in-r/)].

# Base vs. Tidy (re-visited)

.pull-left[

- Tidy data and piping are both *intuitive* and *powerful*.

- All packages in the tidyverse are optimized for tidy data and piping.

- Some packages outside the tidyverse were also developed within the tidy paradigm.

- Nevertheless, many *important* packages and other programming softwares operate outside the logic of tidy.

- [While we like tidy, a better programmer knows both. ](https://github.com/matloff/TidyverseSkeptic/)
