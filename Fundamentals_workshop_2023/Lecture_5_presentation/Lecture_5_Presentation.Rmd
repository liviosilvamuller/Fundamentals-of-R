# R Markdown, a one-stop shop (rmd 1/5)

- Write your text, execute code, and produce high quality (reproducible) reports in [one place](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/gallery.html)!

- [Made for R, free, and with lots of support](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)

- [Do not underestimate R Markdown's potential or flexibility cause it is ugly](https://towardsdatascience.com/ten-awesome-r-markdown-tricks-56ef6d41098)

---

# R Markdown options (rmd 2/5)

- [Code chunk options:](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-15.html)

  - echo
  - eval
  - include
  - warning
  - message
  - fig.cap

- Global options: apply to every code chunk if used in setup

```{r, eval=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)
```

---

# Common Issues (rmd 3/5)

- Adding data (just like a script)

- Latex engines (for PDF rendering mostly in Windows)

- [Figures and tables in PDF](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/pdf-document.html)

- Try to keep code lines in code chunks under 80 characters (marked line)

- Other specific R Markdown issues you had?

# Is Quarto the future? (rmd 5/5)

- [Quarto is handy for users of multiple programming languages, but is it really necessary for R users?](https://yihui.org/en/2022/04/quarto-r-markdown/)

- [Is Quarto just a fancier R Markdown?](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/r.html)

- R Studio's, or shall I say ["Posit"](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3668252/rstudio-changes-name-to-posit-expands-focus-to-include-python-and-vs-code.html#:~:text=RStudio%20is%20changing%20its%20corporate,user%20conference%20in%20Washington%2C%20D.C.), attempt to become a more flexible platform

- If you know a bit of Rmarkdown, getting started with Quarto is relatively easy, see this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shVSmYna3GM&list=PLPwprT5wdzX7NVDl4oYQ7c2_6ox0_1fyr)

**Attention, Quarto requires the latest version of R Studio...**

# Github, worth more than this one mention...

- [The worlds biggest code hosting platform for collaborations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E)

- Make your research available online (just like [Livio](https://github.com/liviosilvamuller) and [I](https://github.com/henriquesposito))

- From hosting your websites and applications, to other types of online collaborative [work](https://happygitwithr.com/big-picture.html)

*If you are interested on how we work with GitHub to build, store, version, and release R packages, check out the [messydates](https://github.com/globalgov/messydates) GitHub site.

# Exchanging with the community (reprex 1/9)

- [Reproducibility](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example) of an error is the key

- Don't forget about the [minimal](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/articles/reprex-dos-and-donts.html) part

- The better the question, the better the [answer](https://data.library.virginia.edu/ask-better-code-questions-and-get-better-answers-with-reprex/)

- You do not need any package to make a minimal reproducible example, but the [reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) package can help!

# The question (reprex 2/9)

"Dear R friends,

I am having issues getting the mean for a variable in my dataset in R.

As you see, the code returns "NA", even though I am removing NAs to calculate the mean.

Below, you will find a sample of my data, code, and system info so that you can reproduce the issue.

Could you please help me?

Thank you in advance for your time and consideration!"

---

# The data (reprex 3/9)

[`set.seed()`](https://r-coder.com/set-seed-r/) orders random processes

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
my.df <- data.frame(col1 = sample(c(1,2), 5, replace = TRUE),
                    col2 = as.factor(sample(5)), col3 = letters[1:5],
                    col4 = sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), 5, replace = TRUE))
my.df
```

Using R datasets (e.g. `USArrests`, `mtcars`, `iris`) is also very handy!

---

# The error (reprex 4/9)

If you are doing this manually, copy the exact error somewhere in the post!

```{r}
mean(my.df$col1)
mean(my.df$col2, na.rm = TRUE)
```

---

# The system (reprex 5/9)

Sometimes system info can be important...

```{r, eval=FALSE}
search()
sessionInfo()
R.Version()
R.Version()$version.string
```

# The post (reprex 6/9)

*Dear R friends, I am having issues getting the mean for a variable in my dataset in R. As you see, the code returns "NA", even though I am removing NAs to calculate the mean. Below, you will find a sample of my data, code, and sytem info so that you can reproduce the issue. Could you please help me? Thank you in advance for your time and consideration!*

set.seed(1234)

my.df <- data.frame(col1 = sample(c(1,2), 5, replace = TRUE),
                    col2 = as.factor(sample(5)), col3 = letters[1:5],
                    col4 = sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), 5, replace = TRUE))

mean(my.df$col2, na.rm = TRUE)

'#> [1] NA'

'#> Warning in mean.default(my.df$col2, na.rm = TRUE): argument is not numeric or logical: returning NA'

'#> R version: 4.1.2 (2021-11-01) / Loaded packages: dplyr and tidyr'

#  Reprex, the package (reprex 7/9)

- Writing a reprex often helps you debug!

- It may not look like much, but ... 

- In practice, allows you to copy and paste to post.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("reprex")
reprex::reprex({
  R.Version()$version.string
  search()
  set.seed(1234)
  my.df <- data.frame(col1 = sample(c(1,2), 5, replace = TRUE),
                      col2 = as.factor(sample(5)), col3 = letters[1:5],
                      col4 = sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), 5, replace = TRUE))
  mean(my.df$col2, na.rm = TRUE)
})
```

# Reprex for R Markdown, more or less the same (reprex 8/9)

***Rules-of-thumb:***

  - If issue is within a code chunk, make a normal reprex
  
  - If issue is with knitting, copy the document (yaml) header and all code chunks until the one that fails to knit or displays the issue (the rest is the same)
  
  - If you want to improve the knitting itself, post a (minimal) R Markdown document and the knitted document

---

# Stack overflow, one last time (reprex 9/9)

- You can find virtually anything about an [R issue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r)

- [R community can sometimes be annoying, so ask well](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2011/01/three-tips-for-posting-good-questions-to-r-help-and-stack-overflow/)

- If anything, remember the golden rule of copy and paste (i.e. others need to be able to copy and paste your code and reproduce the error)

**[R bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/), [Community R](https://community.rstudio.com/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats), and even [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rstats/), if that is your thing**

- Hopefully, this course has made it easier for you to understand R code and errors, think through data, and find help online for your specific needs

- But there are some other courses and summer schools that can help as well

# Courses (future 2/3)

- [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/learn/r) is not free, but it is good!

- For more on data wrangling check out [Kelsey Gonzalez'](https://www.youtube.com/@KelseyGonzalez) course; for more on data science check [Dave Langer's](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTJTBoU5HOCRrTs3cJK-PbHM39cwCU0PF) course; for more on modelling and regression see this
[Stanford](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvySJGj-88U&list=PLoROMvodv4rOzrYsAxzQyHb8n_RWNuS1e&index=1) course

- Several free courses available from various universities as [Harvard](https://pll.harvard.edu/subject/r), for example, and [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming#syllabus) which are free to audit

- Learn R on your own within R with the "swirl" package

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('swirl') 
library(swirl) 
swirl()
```

# Summer methods schools (future 3/3)

- Expensive and often very specific, but worth it if you can afford (or get a scholarship)

- [GSERM](https://gserm.org/), we cannot recommend enough!

- A lot more out there in person and online ([ECPR](https://ecpr.eu/SummerSchool), [USI](https://www.usi.ch/it/formazione/apprendimento-permanente/summer-winter-school/ssm/workshops), and more)
