# R Basics

*"All I know is what I have words for” - Ludwig Wittgenstein*

--

## Objects

- What are objects in R?

--

Can be anything, as long as it is assigned...

```{r}
"Am I an object?"
object <- "Or I am an object?"
```

---
# The rules of the game (class 1/6)

*Object class is the grouping of objects that can be described in terms of the attributes its members have in common.*

Can anything be a class?

--

Yes, as long as the rules of the game are set as methods and are coherent!

--

But we are only talking about a few basic ones today...

---
# Character (class 2/6)

Just text...

```{r}
object1 <- "Or I am an object?"
class(object1)
# What can we do with character objects?
paste(object1, object1, sep = " - ")
```

---
# Numeric (class 3/6)

Some classes allow for arithmetic operations

```{r}
object2 <- 3
class(object2)
# Can we operate on numeric objects?
(object2*object2)/(object2+object2)
# Remember, parenthesis are important for the order of operations!
```

---
# Logical (class 4/6)

Either TRUE or FALSE

```{r}
true <- TRUE
class(true)
isTRUE(true) # Logical check
```

---
# Dates (class 5/6)

Dates in R can be annoying, specially if you are using base R...

```{r}
Sys.Date() # Get the current date
date <- Sys.Date()
class(date) # What can we do with data?
Sys.Date() - 1
```

Some R packages are excellent for this though [´{lubridate}´](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v040i03) and [´{messydates}´](https://globalgov.github.io/messydates/)

---
# Wait, what is that about "type"? (class 6/6)

Object class is often not the same as the object type...

Type refers to how the data is stored; the 5 basic types in R are double, integer, complex, logical, character

```{r}
class(1)
typeof(1)
```

**But if this is confusing to you, do not worry about it ...**

# You can navigate (through data) if you have $ (functions 1/6)

--

Is the "$" operator a function in R? (Hint: see ´?"$"´)

```{r}
# The $ operator can be used to extract part from an object:
course$lecturers
# Or replace parts of an object:
course$lecturers <- c("Sposito", "Silva-Muller")
```

**An operator in R is a function that can be written without parentheses...**

---
# If you do not have $, friends can help :[] (functions 2/6)

--

Brackets make some great friends (run ´?"["´ for help)

```{r}
course$lecturers[1] # first element in vector
course[1,0] # first row in all columns
course[0,1] # all rows in first column
course[1, 1] # first value in first column
```

---
# Factors (functions 3/6)

*Factor* in R refers to categories in variables

```{r}
course$lecturers <- factor(course$lecturers, levels = c("Silva-Muller", "Sposito"))
course$lecturers
```

---
# Logical operators (functions 4/6)

- "=="/"!=" are values equal/different?
- is bigger/bigger or equal ">"/">="  than?
- is smaller/smaller or equal "<"/"<=" than?

```{r}
course$lecturers[1] == course$lecturers[2]
course$age[2] < course$age[1]
```

--

**For multiple conditions, use "&"/"|" (and/or)**

```{r}
course$lecturers[1] != course$lecturers[2] & course$age[2] < course$age[1]
```

---
# If it is true, then yes! (functions 5/6)

We function ´ifelse()´ works with conditional element selection... (wait what?)

--

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ifelse(test, yes, no)
```

--

```{r}
course$old = ifelse(course$age > 30, "old", "young")
course
```

---
# GREP (Grammar of Regular Expressions) (functions 6/6)

Functions to find, match and replace strings!

```{r}
# Can we find if there is an "silva" in a variable?
grepl("silva", course$lecturers, ignore.case = TRUE)
# What if we want to replace it?
course$lecturers <- gsub("Silva", "Awesome", course$lecturers)
course
