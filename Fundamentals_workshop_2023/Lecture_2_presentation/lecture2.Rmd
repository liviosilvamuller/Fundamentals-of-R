# R Basics

*"All I know is what I have words for” - Ludwig Wittgenstein*

--

## Objects

- What are objects in R?

--

Can be anything, as long as it is assigned...

```{r}
"Am I an object?"
object_1 <- "Or I am an object?"
object_1
```

---
# The rules of the game (class 1/6)

*Object class is the grouping of objects that can be described in terms of the attributes its members have in common.*

Can anything be a class?

--

Yes, as long as the rules of the game are set as methods and are coherent!

--

But we are only talking about a few basic ones today...

---
# Character (class 2/6)

Just text...

```{r}
object_character <- "Or I am an object?"
class(object_character)
# What can we do with character objects?
paste(object_character, object_character, sep = " - ")
```

---
# Numeric (class 3/6)

Some classes allow for arithmetic operations

```{r}
object_numeric <- 3
class(object_numeric)
# Can we operate on numeric objects?
(object_numeric*object_numeric)/(object_numeric+object_numeric)
# Remember, parenthesis are important for the order of operations!
```

---
# Logical (class 4/6)

Either TRUE or FALSE

```{r}
object_logical <- TRUE
class(object_logical)
isTRUE(object_logical) # Logical check
```

---
# Dates (class 5/6)

Dates in R can be annoying, specially if you are using base R...

```{r}
Sys.Date() # Get the current date
object_date <- Sys.Date()
class(object_date) # What can we do with data?
Sys.Date() - 1
```

Some R packages are excellent for this though [´{lubridate}´](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v040i03) and [´{messydates}´](https://globalgov.github.io/messydates/)

---
# Beware: object $\neq$  type

.pull-left[

Type refers to how the data is stored; the 5 basic types in R are double, integer, complex, logical, character

```{r}
class(1)
typeof(1)
```

**But if this is confusing to you, do not worry about it ...**

# So far...

--

 We create objects by assigning things.

--

Objects have a class, which defines what sort of operations I can do with objects.

--

Class is different than type.

--

Now let's learn about data structures: 
- vectors,
- matrices,
- dataframes,
- and lists.

---

# Vectors (data structures 1/4)

*Vector*: one-dimensional with one class of data

.pull-left[

```{r}
lecturers <- c("Henrique", "Livio") # character
age <- c(81, 18) # numeric
speaks_portuguese <- c(TRUE, TRUE) # logical
```

]

# Matrixes (data structures 2/4)

*Matrix*: two dimensional objects with one class and a fixed number of rows/columns

.pull-left[

```{r}
matrix_1 <- matrix(0, ncol = 2, nrow = 2)
matrix_1
dim(matrix_1)
```

There are also *arrays*, three or more dimensional objects of one class, but do not worry about it now.

# Data Frames (data structures 3/4)

*Data frames* objects can have multiple possible classes but a fixed number of rows and columns

.pull-left[
```{r}
course <- data.frame(cbind(lecturers, age, speaks_portuguese))
course
# cbind() binds columns, rbind() binds rows
```
]

# Lists (data structures 4/4)

*Lists*: group together R objects of diverse classes or dimensions.

```{r}
list <- list(lecturers, age, speaks_portuguese, 3,course)
```

# You can navigate (through data) if you have $ (functions 1/5)

--

Is the "$" operator a function in R? (Hint: see ´?"$"´)

```{r}
# The $ operator can be used to extract part from an object:
course$lecturers
# Or replace parts of an object:
course$lecturers <- c("Sposito", "Silva-Muller")
```

**An operator in R is a function that can be written without parentheses...**

---
# If you do not have $, friends can help :[] (functions 2/5)

--

Brackets make some great friends (run ´?"["´ for help)

```{r}
course$lecturers[1] # first element in vector
course[1,] # first row in all columns
course[,1] # all rows in first column
#course[1, 1] # first value in first column
```

---
# Logical operators (functions 3/5)

- "=="/"!=" are values equal/different?
- is bigger/bigger or equal ">"/">="  than?
- is smaller/smaller or equal "<"/"<=" than?

```{r}
course$lecturers[1] == course$lecturers[2]

course$age[2] < course$age[1]

```

--

**For multiple conditions, use "&"/"|" (and/or)**

```{r}
course$lecturers[1] != course$lecturers[2] & course$age[2] < course$age[1]
```

---
# If it is true, then yes! (functions 4/5)

We function ´ifelse()´ works with conditional element selection... (wait what?)

--

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ifelse(test, yes, no)
```

--

```{r}
course$old <- ifelse(course$age > 30, "old", "young")
course
```

---
# GREP (Grammar of Regular Expressions) (functions 5/5)

Functions to find, match and replace strings!

```{r}
# Can we find if there is an "silva" in a variable?
grepl("silva", course$lecturers, ignore.case = TRUE)
# What if we want to replace it?
course$lecturers <- gsub("Silva", "Awesome", course$lecturers)
course
```

Gotcha you!

--

One last thing: factors!

---
# Factors (class 6/6)

--
*Factor* in R refers to a variables that have a fixed and known set of possible values(days of the week, months, possible survey responses,...). *Anything can be a treated as a factor, if you want*:
--
```{r}
course$age <- factor(course$age, levels = c(0:122))
course$age
```
--

```{r}
summary(course$lecturers)
```
--

```{r}
course$lecturers <- factor(course$lecturers, levels = c("Sposito","Awesome-Muller","Yildiz"))
summary(course$lecturers)
```
---

# Other useful functions we forgot?

*Henrique*

```{r, eval=FALSE}

```

--

.pull-right[
*Livio*

```{r}
unique(c(2, 2, 2, "three", "three",TRUE))
```
]

--

```{r}
mean(c(18, 81, 28))
median(c(18, 81, 28, NA))
median(c(18, 81, 28, NA), na.rm=TRUE)
```

# Base R

- All operators we cover today are base R

- [Above all, teaching base R facilitates comprehension of how R, as a software and programming language, works for beginners](https://github.com/matloff/TidyverseSkeptic/)

---
# Summing Up!

- You can create objects as long as you assign it.

--

- Objects have a class (character, numeric, logical, factor, etc...) and also a type (but do not worry about this now).

--

- Depending on dimensions and class, combined objects become datastructures: vectors, matrices, dataframes, lists, etc...

--

- The datastructure we will use the most are dataframes, which stores vectors of different classes but same lenght.

--

- You can navigate through data structures and do operations in it.
