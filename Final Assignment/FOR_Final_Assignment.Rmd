# CO2 Emissions along time

For the final assignment, we will analyze C02 emissions from 1990 to 2019 and whether it correlates with a a few variables.
The [World Bank Data Repository](https://data.worldbank.org/) contains multiple country-year datasets that can help us do so.
All the datasets share the same country names and codes, but not all of them are tidy.
For the final assignment, we are providing you with four datasets: (1)`co2_emissions`, (2) `country_region`, (3) `gdp`, and (4) `pop_dat`.

## Question 1: tidying and joining data

Using the four datasets available, create a single tidy dataset named `co2_dat` containing the following variables:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Name                 Description
 -------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------
`country_name`        Name of the country
 
`country_code`        Code of the country
 
`year`                Year of the observation
 
`region`              Region of the country according to world bank
 
`income_group`        Income group of the country according to the world bank
 
`co2_emissions`       CO2 emissions in a given year
  
`total_pop`           Total population in a given year

`urban_pop_share`     Share of urban population in a given year (in percentage)

`gdp`                 Gross domestic product in a given year
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Question 2: missing values

Our dataset still contains missing values.

a-) Venezuela is missing values for `income_group`. According to the [World Bank](https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/new-world-bank-country-classifications-income-level-2021-2022), Venezuela , previously classified as a an upper-middle income country, is now unclassified due to a lack of available data in the recent period. Classify Venezuela as an upper-middle income country. 

b-) Drop all observations with missing values in any variable.

## Question 3: inspecting the dataset

a-) Check whether all classes of the variables are correct.

b-) How many countries are there?

c-) How many observations are there?

## Question 4: normalizing our measures

We will need a few new variables for the subsequent analysis, create the following:

`co2_per_cap`, which is the `co2_emissions` divided by `total_pop`.

`gdp_per_cap`, which is the `gdp` divided by `total_pop`.

## Question 5: top emitters

a-) Rank countries by their total `co2_emissions` , print the top 20 emitters.

b-) Rank countries by their mean `co2_per_cap`, print the top 20 emitters. Write a brief paragraph commenting how this rank is different than the one from question 5a.

c-) Create new dataset named decades_rank,which contains three variables (one for each decade) 1990s,2000s, and 2010s, and one variable for country name.
Values in the decade column should contain the mean emissions per capita of a given country in that decade. Did the top three emitters per capita changed in these decades?

## Question 6: emissions in time

a-) Create a plot showing the yearly evolution of `co2_per_cap`.

b-) Now create a plot showing the yearly evolution of `co2_per_cap` for the United States, China, and India.

c-) Finally, create a plot showing the yearly evolution of `co2_per_cap` by `income_group`.

d-) In light of the three plots, what can you say about co2 emissions along time?


## Question 7: emissions, growth, and population

a-) Create a plot showing the relationship between `co2_emissions` and `population`, faceted by `income_group`.

b-) Create a box plot showing the distribution of `co2_per_cap` by `income_group`. Comment the relationship between emissions, growth and population.

c-) Re-create the plot from b-) as a histogram.(Tip: search for help online!)

## Question 8:urban population and co2 emissions

a-) Are countries with higher urban populations, higher emitters on average? Create a plot.

b-) Does the relationship hold for different income groups *or* for different regions? Create one plot for each.

## Question 9: top emitters, revisited

Create a bar plot that ranks countries by their `co2_emissions` overall. Countries should be colored differently if they are within top 20 emitters in terms of `co2_per_cap` overall.
