# What is R?

- Programming language and software develop in 1990s by Ihaka and Gentleman [(see Ihaka and Gentleman 1996)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1390807#metadata_info_tab_contents), but really only released in 2000...

- Open source with extensive and coherent set of tools for statistical analysis

- But much more than an statistics software, from text analysis to presentations (like this one), interactive Shinny applications, and much more!

**Thank you RStudio (and [Hadley](https://hadley.nz/))!**

# Why R?

--
.pull-left[

- Fast(ish), Flexible, and Free

- Visualize, Communicate, and Share

- Thousands of packages and collaborative community

- Reproducible

- Easily integrated with other programming languages (as Phyton and C)

- [R growth has been impressive, specially within academia and governments](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/10/10/impressive-growth-r/)

# Course objectives

By the end of this course you should be able to:

- import data

- clean and wrangle

- visualize variation

- produce reproducible reports

***Above all:***

- *How to continue to learn R on your own*

- *How to ask/find help online*

# Polices and assignements

- Attendance (just come to class and be respectful)

- Weekly assignments (try your best and remember to ask for help)

- Final assignment (the one that really counts)

---
# How to... google

- R is collaborative

- Google, google, google (and stack overflow) until you make it!

- "How to (...) in R?"

- But if none of that works, ask in the Moodle and we will help

# Thinking clearly (with data)

- No statistical software is a substitute for clear conceptual thinking, they are just tools (specially in R)...

- 

---
# Rstallation

- If you do not have R installed, stay and we will try together...

- If yes, you have a 5 minutes brake...
