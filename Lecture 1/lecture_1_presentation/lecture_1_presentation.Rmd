# What is R?

- Programming language and software develop in 1990s by Ihaka and Gentleman [(see Ihaka and Gentleman 1996)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1390807#metadata_info_tab_contents), but really only released in 2000...

- Open source with extensive and coherent set of tools for statistical analysis and programming

- More than a statistics software:
  - text analysis
  - scraping
  - websites
  - interactive applications
  - presentations (like this one)
  - and much more!

**Thank you RStudio (and [Hadley](https://hadley.nz/))!**

# Why R?

--
.pull-left[

- [R growth has been impressive, specially within academia and governments](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/10/10/impressive-growth-r/)


- Fast(ish), Flexible, and Free

- Visualize, Communicate, Share, and Reproduce

- Thousands of packages

- Other programming languages can be integrated (as Phyton and C)

**No statistical software is a substitute for clear conceptual thinking, they are just tools (specially R). Thinking and data are compliments, not substitutes (Mesquita and Fowler 2021).**

# How to... google

- R is collaborative

- Google, google, google (and stack overflow) until you make it!

- "How to (...) in R?"

- But if none of that works, ask in the Moodle and we will help
