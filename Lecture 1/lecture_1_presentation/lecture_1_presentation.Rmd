# What is R?

- Programming language and software develop in 1990s by Ihaka and Gentleman [(see Ihaka and Gentleman 1996)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1390807#metadata_info_tab_contents), but really only released in 2000...

- Open source with extensive and coherent set of tools for statistical analysis

- But much more than an statistics software, from text analysis to presentations (like this one), interactive Shinny applications, and much more!

**Thank you RStudio (and Hadley)!**

# Why R?

--
.pull-left[

- Fast(ish), Flexible, and Free

- Visualize, Communicate, and Share

- Thousands of packages and collaborative community

- Reproducible

- Easily integrated with other programming languages (as Phyton and C)

- [R growth has been impressive, specially within academia and governments](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/10/10/impressive-growth-r/)
